`
  Async in Sequence or Async in Series
  
  The task is to execute multiple asynchronous tasks sequentially and handle their results 
  and errors. Specifically, create an array of asynchronous tasks, execute them one after 
  the other in sequence, and process the results and errors using a callback function. 
  Additionally, ensure that any unhandled promise rejections are properly logged.

  Asynchronous programming allows a program to perform tasks without blocking the main 
  execution flow, enabling tasks to be initiated and completed at different times. 
  In JavaScript, promises are used to handle asynchronous operations, representing a 
  value that may be available now, or in the future, or never.

  concurrency is managed using asynchronous programming with promises, but tasks 
  are executed sequentially.
