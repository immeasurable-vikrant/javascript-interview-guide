`DOM Finder: (refer to domFinder.html file in explorer)

The goal is to find the equivalent node in a second tree (rootB) that matches
the structure and position of a given node (nodeA) in the first tree (rootA). Once we
locate the equivalent node in the second tree, we want to retrieve its text content.
The concept involves two main parts:
    - Path from Child to Parent: For a given node (nodeA) in the first tree (rootA),
    we need to determine the path from this node up to the root. This path can be 
    represented as a series of indices that describe the position of each node 
    relative to its parent.

    - Value from Path: Using the path obtained from the first tree, we traverse the 
    second tree (rootB) to find the equivalent node. We then retrieve the text 
    content of this node.

  // Array to store the path (indices of child nodes relative to their parents)
  const pathArray = [];

  // Loop until the current node is equal to the parent node
  while (currentNode !== parent) {
    // Get the parent element of the current node
    const parentElement = currentNode.parentElement;
    // Convert the parent's children into an array for easier manipulation
    const childrenArray = Array.from(parentElement.children);
    // Find the index of the current node among its siblings and push it to the path array
    pathArray.push(childrenArray.indexOf(currentNode));
    // Move up to the parent node
    currentNode = parentElement;
  }

  // Return the path from child to parent as an array of indices
  return pathArray;

// Function to get the value of a node given its path from the root
const getValueFromPath = (parent, path) => {
  // Start from the parent node
  let currentNode = parent;

  // Traverse the tree using the path
  while (path.length) {
    // Pop the last index from the path array to get the next child node
    currentNode = currentNode.children[path.pop()];
  }

  // Return the text content of the final node
