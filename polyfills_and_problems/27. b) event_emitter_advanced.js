`PubSub/ Event Emitter Asked in Microsoft Interview`

`
  The problem involves creating a Pub/Sub (Publish-Subscribe) system or an Event Emitter in 
  JavaScript, which is a common design pattern used to handle asynchronous events. This pattern 
  is useful in decoupling the parts of a program that produce events (publishers) from the parts 
  that respond to them (subscribers). The Pub/Sub pattern is frequently used in scenarios where 
  multiple components need to communicate without tight coupling.

  Concept and Design Pattern
  Pub/Sub (Publish-Subscribe) Pattern:

  Publisher: The entity that sends out events.

  Subscriber: The entity that listens for and handles events.

  Event Channel: The medium through which events are transmitted from publishers 
  to subscribers.

  The pattern provides an interface where:
  - Subscribers can register interest in certain types of events and provide callback 
  functions to be executed when such events occur.
  - Publishers can emit events, triggering all subscribed callbacks.


  Event Emitter:
  This is a more generalized form of the Pub/Sub pattern. It allows for:

  - Subscribing to events (subscribe).
  - Subscribing to events only once (subscribeOnce and subscribeOnceAsync).
  - Publishing events (publish).
  - Publishing events to all subscribers (publishAll).`;

class Events {
  constructor() {
    // Maps to store subscribers for different event types
    this.subscriptionList = new Map();
    this.subscribeOnceList = new Map();
    this.subscribeOnceAsyncList = new Map();
  }

  // Method to subscribe to an event
  subscribe(name, callback) {
    // Add callback to the subscription list for the event name
    if (!this.subscriptionList.has(name)) {
      this.subscriptionList.set(name, [callback]);
    } else {
      const existingCallbacks = this.subscriptionList.get(name);
      this.subscriptionList.set(name, [...existingCallbacks, callback]);
    }

    // Return an object with a remove method to unsubscribe
    return {
      remove: () => {
        const existingCallbacks = this.subscriptionList.get(name);
        const filtered = existingCallbacks.filter((e) => e !== callback);
        this.subscriptionList.set(name, filtered);
      },
    };
  }

  // Method to subscribe to an event only once
  subscribeOnce(name, callback) {
    // Add callback to the subscribe-once list for the event name
    if (!this.subscribeOnceList.has(name)) {
      this.subscribeOnceList.set(name, [callback]);
    } else {
      const existingCallbacks = this.subscribeOnceList.get(name);
      this.subscribeOnceList.set(name, [...existingCallbacks, callback]);
    }
  }

  // Method to subscribe to an event only once asynchronously
  async subscribeOnceAsync(name) {
    // Return a promise that resolves when the event is published
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      if (!this.subscribeOnceAsyncList.has(name)) {
        this.subscribeOnceAsyncList.set(name, [resolve]);
      } else {
        const existingCallbacks = this.subscribeOnceAsyncList.get(name);
        this.subscribeOnceAsyncList.set(name, [...existingCallbacks, resolve]);
      }
    });
  }

  // Method to publish an event
  publish(name, data) {
    // Invoke all callbacks in the subscription list for the event name
    const callbacks = this.subscriptionList.get(name) || [];
    callbacks.forEach((cb) => {
      cb(data);
    });

    // Invoke all callbacks in the subscribe-once list and clear them
    const subscribeOnceCallbacks = this.subscribeOnceList.get(name) || [];
    subscribeOnceCallbacks.forEach((cb) => {
      cb(data);
    });
    this.subscribeOnceList.set(name, []);

    // Invoke all async callbacks in the subscribe-once-async list and clear them
    const subscribeOnceAsyncCallbacks =
      this.subscribeOnceAsyncList.get(name) || [];
    subscribeOnceAsyncCallbacks.forEach((cb) => {
      cb(data);
    });
    this.subscribeOnceAsyncList.set(name, []);
  }

  // Method to publish data to all events
  publishAll(data) {
    // Iterate over all events and invoke all callbacks with the data
    for (const [key, value] of this.subscriptionList.entries()) {
      value.forEach((cb) => {
        cb(data);
      });
    }
  }
}

// Example usage
const events = new Events();

console.log("Hello");

events.subscribeOnceAsync("new-user").then(function (payload) {
  console.log(`I am invoked once ${payload}`);
});

events.publish("new-user", "Foo Once Async");

`Key Points:

Subscription Management:
- subscriptionList holds persistent subscriptions.
- subscribeOnceList holds one-time subscriptions.
- subscribeOnceAsyncList holds one-time subscriptions resolved asynchronously.

Subscription Methods:
- subscribe(name, callback): Adds a callback to the list for the event.
- subscribeOnce(name, callback): Adds a callback to be called only once.
- subscribeOnceAsync(name): Adds a callback to be called once, returning a promise.

Publishing Methods:
- publish(name, data): Triggers callbacks for the event, including one-time callbacks.
- publishAll(data): Triggers all callbacks for all events.
