Hashtable Data Structure:

    A hashtable is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. 
    It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, 
    from which the desired value can be found. This index is unique for each key, 
    allowing for fast retrieval of values.

Hash Maps:

    Hash maps are essentially the same as hashtables, often used interchangeably. 
    They provide a way to map keys to values, using a hash function for indexing. 
    In many programming languages, like Java or Python, "HashMap" is a specific 
    implementation of a hashtable.

Objects in JavaScript:

    In JavaScript, objects are collections of key-value pairs where the keys are strings or symbols, 
    and the values can be any data type, including other objects. They're one of the most fundamental 
    data structures in JavaScript, providing a flexible way to structure data and build complex systems.`;

`   
Hash Collision:

    A hash collision occurs when two different keys produce the same hash value. Since the hash 
    function in our HashTable class maps keys to array indices, if two different keys result in 
    the same index, we have a collision.`

`Now, to explain the difference and why arrays are used as buckets in hashtables:

Difference:
    Hashtable vs. Hashmap: In practice, there's often no significant difference between 
    hashtables and hashmaps. The terms are used interchangeably in many programming languages. 
    The key idea is that both allow for fast key-value pair retrieval through hashing.

Why Array Buckets:
    Arrays are used as buckets in hashtables because they provide constant-time access to elements 
    based on their index. When you hash a key to get an index, you need to store the corresponding 
    value somewhere. Arrays are well-suited for this purpose because they allow for direct access 
    to elements at specific indices, making retrieval fast.

Example:
    Imagine you're organizing books in a library. Each book has a unique ID (like a key), and you 
    want to store them efficiently. Instead of arranging the books alphabetically (which would take 
    time to search through), you decide to use a system where each shelf has a unique number 
    (like an index). When someone asks for a book, you quickly locate it by going directly to the 
    shelf corresponding to its ID. This is similar to how hashtables use arrays as buckets â€“ they 
    provide a fast way to locate values based on their hashed keys.
    So, in simple terms, hashtables and hashmaps are efficient ways to store key-value pairs, and 
    they use arrays as buckets because arrays provide fast access to elements based on their indices, 
    making retrieval quick and efficient.`;
