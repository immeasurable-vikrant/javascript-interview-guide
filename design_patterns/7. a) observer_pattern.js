// Observer Pattern (Behavioral design pattern)
// Behavioral design patterns focus on communication and interaction between objects, 
// defining how they collaborate and share responsibilities. They aim to improve flexibility 
// in carrying out complex tasks by establishing efficient and manageable interaction patterns.

`What it does: The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern where an object, known as 
the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them of any 
changes in its state.

What problem it solves: It provides a way to establish one-to-many dependencies between 
objects, allowing multiple objects to listen for changes in another object's state and 
react accordingly.
`


`Why it's important: It enables loosely coupled communication between objects, promoting 
flexibility and maintainability in software design.

Why use it: It's useful when the state of one object needs to be propagated to multiple 
other objects without them being tightly coupled to each other.`

`Problem it Solves:
  The Observer Pattern solves the problem of establishing one-to-many dependencies between 
  objects by enabling an object (the subject) to notify multiple other objects (observers) 
  of changes in its state without tightly coupling them together. This promotes decoupling, 
  scalability, flexibility, maintainability, and reusability in software design.`


`How it works: The Observer Pattern typically involves a subject class that maintains a 
list of observers and provides methods to add, remove, and notify observers.
How to implement it:


Observer Pattern in Real World Examples:
  UI Components: In graphical user interfaces (GUIs), the Observer Pattern is often used to 
    update UI components based on changes in underlying data models. For example, updating 
    a progress bar based on the progress of a file download.

  Event Handling: Many programming frameworks and libraries use the Observer Pattern 
    for event handling. Events are observed by listeners or subscribers, and actions 
    are taken accordingly. For instance, handling user input events in web development 
    or GUI applications.

  Stock Market: In financial applications, the Observer Pattern can be used to 
    notify investors or traders about changes in stock prices or market trends.

  Important: RxJS provide implementations of the Observer Pattern
`

// Example:

class Subject {
  constructor() {
    this.observers = [];
  }

  addObserver(observer) {
    this.observers.push(observer);
  }

  removeObserver(observer) {
    this.observers = this.observers.filter(obs => obs !== observer);
  }

  notifyObservers() {
    this.observers.forEach(observer => observer.update());
  }

  // Other methods to manipulate the subject's state
}

class Observer {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  update() {
    console.log(`${this.name} has been notified of a change.`);
  }
}

// Usage
const subject = new Subject();

const observer1 = new Observer('Observer 1');
const observer2 = new Observer('Observer 2');

subject.addObserver(observer1);
subject.addObserver(observer2);

// Trigger a change
subject.notifyObservers();

// Explanation:
`In the example above, Subject is the object being observed, and Observer is the object
observing changes in the subject.

The Subject maintains a list of observers and provides methods to add, remove, and 
notify observers.

Observer defines an update method that is called when the subject notifies observers 
of a change.
Observers can be added or removed dynamically, and when the subject's state changes, 
it notifies all registered observers.

Summary:
The Observer Pattern facilitates communication between objects in a loosely coupled manner. 
It allows objects to subscribe to changes in the state of another object and react accordingly. 
By separating concerns and promoting modularity, it enhances code flexibility and 
maintainability, making it a valuable tool in software design.`
