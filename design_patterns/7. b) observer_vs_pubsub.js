// Observer Pattern:
`Definition: The Observer Pattern establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects, 
where one object (the subject) maintains a list of its dependents (observers) and 
notifies them of any changes in its state.

Communication: In the Observer Pattern, the subject directly notifies all its 
observers synchronously when its state changes.

Relationship: It typically involves a direct relationship between the subject and its observers.
Implementation: Observers are aware of the subject they are observing, and they are 
tightly coupled with it.

// Example:
- Subject: Stock Exchange
- Observers: Investors
- Scenario:
    Subject (Stock Exchange) maintains a list of observers (Investors).
    When the price of a stock changes, the Stock Exchange notifies all subscribed Investors.
    Investors receive the updates and react based on the changes in stock prices

`


// Publish-Subscribe Pattern (Pub-Sub):
`Definition: The Publish-Subscribe Pattern is a messaging pattern where message 
    senders (publishers or topics) don't program the messages to be sent directly to 
    specific receivers (subscribers). Instead, they categorize published messages into 
    classes without knowledge of which subscribers, if any, there may be.

    The Publish-Subscribe Pattern is like a radio station where the station broadcasts its signal, 
    but it doesn't know who's tuning in to listen. So, publishers send messages without knowing 
    who exactly will receive them, and subscribers listen for messages they're interested in 
    without directly communicating with the publishers. It's like sending out invitations to a 
    party without knowing who will show up.

Communication: In Pub-Sub, publishers and subscribers are decoupled. 
    Publishers send messages to a message broker or a specific topic without 
    knowledge of who (if anyone) is listening. Subscribers express interest in 
    one or more topics and receive messages from the broker when they are published.

Relationship: It facilitates a more indirect relationship between publishers and subscribers, 
    often mediated by a message broker or a central topic.

Implementation: Subscribers are unaware of the publishers, and publishers are unaware of the 
    subscribers. They interact through a message broker or a central topic.

Pub/Sub Pattern in Real World Examples:
    Messaging Systems: Pub/Sub is widely used in messaging systems, such as chat applications 
        or social media platforms. Users subscribe to specific channels (topics) of interest, 
        and they receive messages published to those channels.

    IoT (Internet of Things): In IoT applications, Pub/Sub is used for handling sensor data. 
        Sensors publish data to specific topics, and subscribers receive and process this data 
        based on their interests.

    Microservices Architecture: Pub/Sub can be employed in a microservices architecture 
        for communication between services. Services publish events to topics when certain 
        actions occur, and other services subscribe to these topics to react accordingly.

// Example:
- Publishers: Users posting tweets
- Subscribers: Users following specific hashtags
- Message Broker: Twitter's backend system
- Scenario:
    Publishers (Users) post tweets with hashtags.
    Subscribers (Users) follow specific hashtags.
    When a tweet with a hashtag is published, it is sent to Twitter's backend system (Message Broker).
    The Message Broker distributes the tweet to all users who have subscribed to that hashtag, ensuring 
    they receive the tweet in real-time.

    Important: Redis and RabbitMQ offer Pub/Sub functionality.
`


// Similarities:
`Both patterns enable communication between objects without tight coupling, promoting 
flexibility and modularity in software design.
They both facilitate one-to-many communication scenarios, where multiple objects can 
react to changes or events triggered by one object.
Both patterns are used to manage dependencies and establish dynamic relationships 
between components in an application.`

// Differences:
`The Observer Pattern typically involves a direct relationship between subjects and observers, 
whereas the Pub-Sub Pattern facilitates a more indirect, mediated relationship between 
publishers and subscribers.

Pub-Sub introduces an intermediary (message broker or central topic) between publishers and 
subscribers, allowing for more decoupled communication.
The Observer Pattern is more suitable for scenarios where objects need to be aware of each 
other, while Pub-Sub is more suitable for scenarios where loose coupling and scalability 
are priorities.

In summary, while the Observer Pattern and the Pub-Sub Pattern share common goals, 
they have different approaches and are suitable for different use cases based on the 
level of decoupling and scalability required in the application architecture.`
